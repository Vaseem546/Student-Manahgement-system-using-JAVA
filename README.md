# Student Management System


This is a simple **Student Management System** implemented in Java that allows users to manage student information via a command-line interface. The system supports adding new students, retrieving student details by ID, and displaying all stored student records. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like object-oriented design, collections (`HashMap`), and basic input/output handling.

Features

* Add a new student with unique ID, name, and age.
* Retrieve student details by their ID.
* Display all student records stored in the system.
* Simple and user-friendly menu-driven console interface.
* Uses a `HashMap` to efficiently store and access student data.

How It Works

* Upon running, the program presents a menu to the user.
* The user can choose to add a student, get student information by ID, display all students, or exit.
* When adding, the system stores student data in memory.
* Retrieval and display operations use the stored data to show requested information.
* The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.

Technologies Used

* Java SE (Standard Edition)
* Java Collections Framework (`HashMap`)
* Console-based user interaction with `Scanner`
